\begin{enumerate}
\item 1)states:\\$x_1$=\{door1 is reward door, door2 is tiger door\}, 
$x_2$=\{door1 is tiger door, door2 is reward door\};
\\2)actions:\\
$u_1$=\{open door1\}, 
$u_2$=\{open door2\}, 
$u_3$=\{listen\};
\\3)cost(reward) function: \\
$V_{1}(b)=\max\{200p_{1}-1000(1-p_{1}), -1000p_{1}+200(1-p_{1}), -50\}$
\\4)measurement space:\\
$\{z_{1}, z_{2}\}=\{0.8, 0.2\}$=\{prob correctly localize noise, prob to make mistake\} \\
5)associated probabilities: \\

\item "Listen listen open door1"\\
$V_{1}(b)=-50-50+200p_{1}-1000(1-p_{1})$ -we choose $u_{1}$ anyway, independently of result of $u_{3}$, thus we just add doubled expected reward of doing $u_{3}$ and expected reward after doing $u_{1}$
\item "Listen,
then open the door for which you did not hear a noise"
$V_{1}(b)=-50+200*0.8-1000*0.2=-90$ after committing $u_{3}$ we act according to the results of measurements, thus we will open the door with best measurement with probability 0.8.
